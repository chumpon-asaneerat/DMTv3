Please NOTE that this procedure of adding the reporting services described by @Rich Shealer 
above will be iterated every time you start a different project. In order to avoid that:

If you may need to set up a different computer (eg, at home without internet), then keep 
your downloaded installers from the marketplace somewhere safe, ie:

Microsoft.DataTools.ReportingServices.vsix, and
Microsoft.RdlcDesigner.vsix
Fetch the following libraries from the packages or bin folder of the application you have 
created with reporting services in it:

Microsoft.ReportViewer.Common.dll
Microsoft.ReportViewer.DataVisualization.dll
Microsoft.ReportViewer.Design.dll
Microsoft.ReportViewer.ProcessingObjectModel.dll
Microsoft.ReportViewer.WinForms.dll
Install the 2 components from 1 above

Add the dlls from 2 above as references (Project>References>Add...)
(Optional) Add Reporting tab to the toolbar
Add Items to Reporting tab
Browse to the bin folder or where you have the above dlls and add them
You are now good to go! ReportViewer icon will be added to your toolbar, and you will also 
now find Report and ReportWizard templates added to your Common list of templates when you 
want to add a New Item... (Report) to your project

NB: When set up using Nuget package manager, the Report and ReportWizard templates are 
grouped under Reporting. Using my method described above however does not add the Reporting 
grouping in installed templates, but I dont think it is any trouble given that it enables 
you to quickly integrate rdlc without internet and without downloading what you already 
have from Nuget every time!
